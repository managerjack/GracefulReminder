## Script terms & definitions

"using System.Collections": Contains interfaces and classes that define various collections of objects, such as lists, queues, bit arrays, hash tables and dictionaries.

"using System.Collections.Generic": Contains interfaces and classes that define generic collections, which allow users to create strongly typed collections that provide better type safety and performance than non-generic strongly typed collections.

"using UnityEngine": It imports the "UnityEngine" namespace, which is a library of classes and data types that represents it. So if I want to log something to the console, I can write 'Debug.log("Hello user")' because I'm using the "UnityEngine" namespace. Without it, it would be like 'UnityEngine.Debug.log("Hello user")'.
